# Making Change 
The Coin Change Problem is a classic algorithmic challenge in computer science that involves determining the number of ways to make up a given amount of money using a list of coin denominations. The problem statement typically includes an amount of money and a set of coin values, and the goal is to find the number of unique combinations to reach the target amount using the available coins.

## Key Points:
* **Problem Description:** Given an amount of money and a list of coin denominations, the task is to compute the number of ways to make up that amount using the available coins.
* **Approach:** The Coin Change Problem can be solved using dynamic programming techniques, specifically with a bottom-up approach that builds solutions incrementally based on subproblems.
* **Dynamic Programming Solution:** By creating a 2D array where rows represent different coin denominations and columns represent target sums, dynamic programming algorithms can efficiently calculate the number of ways to make change for each sum.
* **Implementation:** The solution involves iterating over coins and amounts, updating the count based on whether a coin is included in the combination or not.
* **Complexity:** The time complexity for solving the Coin Change Problem using dynamic programming is typically O(N\*sum), where N is the number of coins and sum is the target sum.
