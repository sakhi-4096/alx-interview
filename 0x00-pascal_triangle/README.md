# Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known to Chinese mathematicians over 500 years earlier. It is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single number "1" at the top and each subsequent row is generated by adding the two numbers above it. The first few rows of Pascal's Triangle look like this:
```
        1
       1 1
      1 2 1
     1 3 3 1
    1 4 6 4 1
   1 5 10 10 5 1
  1 6 15 20 15 6 1
 1 7 21 35 35 21 7 1
...
```
