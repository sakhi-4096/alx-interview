# Log Parsing 
Log parsing is a process of analyzing log files to extract meaningful information or insights. Log files are often generated by software systems, servers, or applications to record events, errors, or transactions.

## Objective:
The script aims to parse log data from the standard input (sys.stdin). It keeps track of the total file size and counts occurrences of specific HTTP status codes.

* **Initialization:** The script initializes variables such as file_size and count. It defines a list of HTTP status codes (codes) and a dictionary (stats) to store counts for each status code.
* **Parsing:** The script iterates through each line of input (assumed to be log entries). For every 10 lines, it prints the current statistics using the print_stats function.
* **Processing:** For each line, it attempts to extract the HTTP status code (status_code) and increments the corresponding count in the stats dictionary. It also attempts to extract the file size from the log entry and adds it to the total file size.
* **Handling Exceptions:** The script uses exception handling (try and except) to handle potential errors that might occur during parsing, such as IndexError and ValueError.
* **Printing Final Statistics:** After processing all input lines, the script prints the final statistics, including the total file size and counts for each HTTP status code.
* **Keyboard Interrupt Handling:** If a keyboard interrupt (KeyboardInterrupt) occurs, the script prints the current statistics before raising the interrupt again.
