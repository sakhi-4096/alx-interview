# Island Perimeter 
Calculates the perimeter of an island represented by a 2D grid. The island is depicted by cells with a value of 1, while water cells have a value of 0. The function iterates through each cell of the grid, incrementing the perimeter by 4 for each land cell encountered. It then adjusts the perimeter by subtracting 2 for each neighboring land cell to account for shared edges between adjacent land cells. Finally, it returns the calculated perimeter of the island.
