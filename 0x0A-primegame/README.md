# Prime Game
Python function that takes a list of prime numbers as input and determines the winner of a set of prime number removal games. Takes a list of prime numbers as input and returns the winner of the game. The game is played by removing a prime number from the list until only one prime number remains. The player who removes the last prime number is the winner.
The function initializes a variable winner to None to keep track of the winner. It then enters a loop that iterates over each prime number in the input list.
Inside the loop, the function checks if the current prime number is the last prime number in the list. If it is, the function sets the winner variable to the player who removed the last prime number (in this case, "player2").
If the current prime number is not the last prime number in the list, the function removes it from the list and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
After the loop, the function returns the winner variable, which contains the name of the player who won the game.
> In summary, the provided code is a Python function that takes a list of prime numbers as input and determines the winner of a set of prime number removal games. The function iterates over each prime number in the list and removes it until only one prime number remains. The player who removed the last prime number is the winner.
